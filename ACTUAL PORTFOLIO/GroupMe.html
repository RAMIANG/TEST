                    <h5>Requirement #1: Usability </h5>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        Summary of need: The control panel needs to be simplest, sleek, and consistent. This should be
                        minimalistic to reduce confusion.

                        <br><br>
                        Detail of need: The overall design needs to be straightforward in the display of VOL products.
                        This way the user can easily find products they may want.<br> Having clearly labeled
                        navigational tools allow for a less painless experience for the user base.
                        <br><br>
                        Rationale: Users need to be able to learn the system quickly and intuitively. Users should be
                        able to return to the app and recall the knowledge that is in their heads.
                        <br><br>
                        Note: The user group will be students, faculty, and general VOL fans so the design needs to be
                        direct for general understanding and accessibility.

                </div>

                    <h5>User Requirement #2: Security</h5>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        Summary of need: Register feature track orders and payment information
                        <br><br>
                        Detail of need: The design that will be implemented into the application’s interface will have a
                        panel where users can access their account which will hold users’ order history, process of
                        their current order, <br>and payment methods- users can update their payment method.
                        <br><br>
                        Rationale: Information needed for users to input payment details for future orders and
                        information users can seek of the process of their order.<br> Data integrity will be in place to
                        make sure personal credit card information is secured and never given out to unauthorized,
                        third-party organizations.
                        <br><br>
                        Note: Integrity is a built in standard when it comes to PCI usage.

                    <p>
                        Summary of need: Style Guide with utk colors logos and smokey
                        <br><br>
                        Detail of need: UTK brand guidelines are established to unify and communicate with the community.
                        Keeping the visual identity of revolving around utk brand guidelines preserves and communicates the
                        university personality and reputation.
                        <br><br>
                        Rationale: Keeping up with the standard of utk brand guidelines will aid in the strategic vision
                        which aids in user familiarity. <br>Developing a sense of pride, meaningfulness, visionary
                        optimism.<br><br>
                        Note: The need to follow brand guidelines is a necessary legal requirement</p>

            <h1>Design and Conclusions</h1><br>

            <ol>
                <li>The application design aims to fufill a simple sleek design that is easily recognizable from other
                    UTK mobile applications. </li> <br>
                <li>The function of the front page when you click on the app is to sign in as a returning customer or
                    student. But also have the option to create an account if the user doesn’t have a UTK account. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Once in the app, the front page will have the different categories so that the user can get to what
                    they are looking for very easily. Along with this, a tab at the top right which pulls up many
                    different options for the user to change personal information or change preferences. </li><br>
                <li>Having a feed, that is on the bottom, allows users to look at either the most recent things that are
                    for sale or promotions made by the VolShop. The second picture is of the cart tap. This allows the
                    user to see what they have in their cart but also a save for later option that allows them to save
                    items they like but might not want to buy just yet.</li> <br>
                <li>The application on the mobile is deceiving, with a simple sleek design that is easily recognizable
                    from other UTK mobile applications.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <pr> Considerations:</pr>
            <p>We limited our hex codes, fonts, fontsize, and syntax to UTK Branding Guidlines. We also wanted to make
                an option for dark and light mode for better accessibilility.</p>
            <br> <br>
            <h1>Project Takeaways</h1><br>
            <p>The top takeaways for me personally was A LOT. This was my first UX project ever, and on reflection there
                are many things for me to improve. Here are the main things I learned</p><br>
            <li>SYNTAX MUST STAY CONSISTENT. I orginally in the design had both "sign up" and "login", and my teacher
                talked to me about the power of keeping the syntax the same. I went to the VOL SHOP website and reviewed
                the syntax and adjusted accordling.</li><br>
            <li>I AM NOT THE USER. I WILL NEVER BE THE USER. There were many a times where I
                wanted to add something or word something because I liked it. While working on this project I was also
                reading "The Design of Everyday Things" by Don Norman, and I had to step back and doing the design
                protocols that he suggests greatly helped me stay on track.</li><br>
            <li>Everything down to the details is VITAL. Upon reflection I really understand how everything detail down
                to syntax and flow adds to the user experience. From font type, Icon type, placement. It really opened
                my eyes to how much user research and mobile research is important.</li>
